# hello-world
This is the first ever git hub repository I am making. It should do some sort of hello world function. We'll see...

It's surprising it's taken me this long to get into Git Hub programming. I should definitely take this more seriously going forward, there is quite a lot of code that I have in the tank that could be formalized and made strong!
